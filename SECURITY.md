### Security Update Process

1. **Verification**: We verify and reproduce the reported vulnerability
2. **Assessment**: We assess the severity and impact
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Release**: We release a security update
5. **Disclosure**: We publish a security advisory

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using Mermaid Render in your applications:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version with security patches
2. **Validate Input**: Validate and sanitize user-provided diagram code
3. **Limit Permissions**: Run with minimal required permissions
4. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS for external rendering services
5. **Environment Variables**: Secure API keys and configuration secrets
6. **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities

### Input Validation

```python
from mermaid_render import validate_mermaid_syntax, ValidationError

# Always validate user input
def safe_render(user_diagram_code):
    try:
        result = validate_mermaid_syntax(user_diagram_code)
        if not result.is_valid:
            raise ValidationError(f"Invalid diagram: {result.errors}")
        
        # Proceed with rendering only if validation passes
        return render_diagram(user_diagram_code)
    except ValidationError as e:
        # Handle validation errors safely
        log_security_event(f"Invalid diagram input: {e}")
        return None
```

### Configuration Security

```python
import os
from mermaid_render import MermaidConfig

# Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
config = MermaidConfig(
    api_key=os.getenv('MERMAID_API_KEY'),  # Never hardcode API keys
    server_url=os.getenv('MERMAID_SERVER_URL', 'https://mermaid.ink'),
    timeout=int(os.getenv('MERMAID_TIMEOUT', '30'))
)
```

## Known Security Considerations

### External Dependencies

Mermaid Render relies on external services and libraries:

1. **mermaid.ink**: Default rendering service (can be configured)
2. **Third-party APIs**: AI features may use external APIs
3. **Dependencies**: Regular dependency updates for security patches

### Data Privacy

- **Diagram Content**: Diagrams may be sent to external rendering services
- **Caching**: Cached content should be secured appropriately
- **Logs**: Avoid logging sensitive diagram content

### Network Security

- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for external communications
- **Timeouts**: Configure appropriate timeouts to prevent DoS
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for public-facing applications

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

1. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive syntax validation
2. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
3. **Timeout Protection**: Configurable timeouts for external requests
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing to prevent injection attacks

### Configuration Options

```python
# Security-focused configuration
config = MermaidConfig(
    validate_syntax=True,           # Always validate input
    timeout=30,                     # Prevent hanging requests
    max_diagram_size=1024*1024,     # Limit diagram size
    allow_external_urls=False,      # Disable external URL loading
    sanitize_output=True            # Sanitize output content
)
```

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Initial report through secure channels
2. **Collaboration**: Work with researchers to understand and fix issues
3. **Testing**: Thorough testing of fixes before release
4. **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated public disclosure after fixes are available
5. **Credit**: Appropriate credit to security researchers

### Hall of Fame

We maintain a security hall of fame to recognize researchers who help improve our security:

*No security reports have been received yet.*
